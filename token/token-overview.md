# Token Overview

The ACX token governs the decisions that affect the function of Across Protocol as well as the decisions that manage the DAO’s treasury. It is an ERC-20 token.&#x20;

A token allows for decentralized ownership and control of the protocol. The ACX token will control Across Protocol, putting governance decisions in the token holders’ hands.&#x20;

Governance was “turned on” at token launch. The lifecycle of a proposal includes ideation, discussion, proposal, feedback, voting and execution. We use Forum and Snapshot as our governance platforms.

Soon we’ll introduce an optimistic governance tool built in collaboration with UMA and Snapshot.

In addition to governance, ACX also incentivizes liquidity providers and those participating in the Across Referral Link program.&#x20;

Learn about the distribution of ACX [here](https://docs.across.to/token/allocations). You can see the token addresses [here](https://github.com/across-protocol/across-token/blob/master/README.md#addresses).&#x20;
