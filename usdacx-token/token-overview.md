# Token Overview

The Across Protocol token, $ACX, is an ERC-20 token that allows for decentralized ownership and control of the protocol. $ACX governs the decisions affecting the protocol's function as well as the decisions that manage the DAO’s [treasury](https://snapshot.org/#/acrossprotocol.eth/treasury). &#x20;

Governance token power was “turned on” at token launch (November 2022). The lifecycle of a proposal includes ideation, discussion, proposal, feedback, voting and execution. We use [Forum ](https://forum.across.to/)and [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/acrossprotocol.eth/) as our governance platforms, along with [oSnap](https://uma.xyz/osnap), a tool for making on-chain transactions based on off-chain voting decisions. oSnap uses Snapshot and Safe to execute the outcomes of DAO governance votes in a decentralized manner that requires no intervention by privileged signers.

To learn more about how oSnap is used by Across Protocol, please refer to this [article](https://medium.com/across-protocol/welcome-optimistic-governance-838cc649c431).

In addition to governance, $ACX also incentivizes liquidity providers and those participating in the [Across Referral Link program](https://app.across.to/rewards/referrals).&#x20;
