# Bridging

In this section, we walk you through how to perform a bridge transaction through the Across app.

### **Step 1: Enter bridge details**

For this step, you will choose the source [chain](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MlBqw0sVAJZO0pl5jGc/s/o33kX1T6RRp4inOcEH1d/\~/changes/iP8dI29pg9c70nyzaFeV/how-across-works/supported-chains-and-tokens), the asset and amount, and the destination chain.&#x20;

Here is what each dropdown means on the Across Bridge page:

1. **From:** source chain
2. **Asset:** asset you want to transfer
3. **Size:** quantity of the asset you want to transfer
4. **To:** destination chain

Be sure to select the correct chain names from the _From_ dropdown and the _To_ dropdown. You should verify that your wallet is connected to the same network as the source chain.

### **Step 2: Approve contract**

The first time that you bridge a particular token from one chain, you'll need to approve the contract to transfer the token on your behalf. This step is not required if you are using ETH.

Click _Approve_ at the bottom of the page and confirm the transaction in your wallet.

### **Step 3: Bridge away**

The next step is to send the bridge.

At this point, you should verify that you have chosen the correct _From_ and _To_ chain and that you have input the amount of the token that you would like to send. Once you have verified this information, you can click the _Send_ button, and then confirm the transaction in your wallet.

After the transaction has been confirmed in your wallet, you can review the details of the transaction on the confirmation page and monitor its progress on the [transaction page](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MlBqw0sVAJZO0pl5jGc/s/o33kX1T6RRp4inOcEH1d/\~/changes/iP8dI29pg9c70nyzaFeV/how-to-use-across/transactions).&#x20;
