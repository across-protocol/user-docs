# Protocol Rewards

## Rewards Dashboard&#x20;

You may review your accumulated rewards in the [Rewards Dashboard](https://across.to/rewards). If you see accumulated rewards that are unclaimable, please note that Across pays out rewards monthly _after_ the 15th\* of each month. Therefore, if you have accrued awards in December, for example, your $ACX rewards become claimable after January 15th.

_\*Please note that "after the 15th" does not guarantee that rewards are available on the 16th. Rewards may become available **any time**_ _**after the 15th of each month**._
